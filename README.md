# Etch-a-Sketch

An [etch-a-sketch](https://atwycodes.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) project to practice DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript.

Concepts explored & practiced include:
* Searching and retrieving DOM elements in JS.
* Defining new elements in memory
* Altering elements (styles, textcontent)
* Utilising event listeners to invoke functions
* Appending elements to existing parent elements

To do list:
- [x] Color Picker to choose own color
- [x] Clear button will clear grid to default state
- [x] Eraser mode to set brush to default grid color 
- [ ] Random Color button for a "rainbow brush" effect
- [x] Slider for dynamic grid creation
- [ ] Final CSS touch up (shadows, subtle transitions/animations)
- [ ] To implement an alternative way of generating grid with a lower big O notation.
